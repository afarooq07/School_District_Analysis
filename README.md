# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 
In Module 4, a chief data scientist, Maria, for a city school district was tasked to prepare and analyze student funding and standardized testing data for city schools. The purpose of the analysis was to aggregate data to report trends in school performance which willl assist the school board in making decisions regarding school budgets and priorities

## Scope
After the initial analysis, Maria was notified by the school board of potential acedamic dishonesty specifically in regards to 9th grade reading and math score for Thomas high School. 

In order to maintain the integrity of state testing standards, the board has request the analysis repeated by replacing Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading score with NaN. Finally, an analysis report will be provided to examine how these changes impacted overall analysis

## Results


 - **District Summary:** Comparing summary results of the original and repeated analysis, we can see that there isn't any significant difference in average and percentage scores. Repeated analysis show fractionally differences. Overall passing percentage difference is -0.15%
